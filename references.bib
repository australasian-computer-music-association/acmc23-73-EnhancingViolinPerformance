% abstract={This dissertation studies the art and technology of performing music with digital computers. The primary aim of this research is to construct a theoretical framework that enlightens the approach to designing, implementing, evaluating, and iteratively refining new families of digital musical instruments for the real-time expressive control of digital signal processing algorithms. The core of this framework, the Musical Interface Technology Design Space, MITDS, is revealed in chapter four. It is specifically focused on the design of tools that facilitate enhanced performance techniques through the use of multimodal human-computer interfaces in conjunction with algorithmic generation and processing of sound. Musical interface technology is a broad field that encompasses both technological and artistic areas, such as sensor electronics, human-computer interaction, digital signal processing, and software engineering, alongside music performance, composition, and theory. It also involves disciplines such as psychology, ergonomics, physiology, and human cognition and behavior. The first section (chapters 1-2) of this dissertation covers the history of technological developments in the field of computer music, with attention to the human-computer interfaces and what effects they have had on music composition and performance. The second section (chapters 3-4) develops the foundation of a theoretical framework for developing new digital instruments, focusing on both philosophical and pragmatic concepts within musical, technological, and humanistic areas that can be used to guide and inform future directions for research in the field. The third section (chapter 5) incorporates the author's own digital musical instruments, describes their implementations and performance techniques in detail, and uses them as examples to clarify and understand the theoretical framework previously introduced. Finally, the conclusion includes a brief review of the research and developments of new musical interface technologies, the exploration of new performance techniques they bring about, and the teachings and lessons learned during this evolutionary journey into a modern perspective on one of mankind's oldest forms of art - music.},

@article{Hutchins:history,
   abstract = {From the probable origins of the violin in the early 16th century there is a long history of experimentation; first, the empirical development of the violin by the makers themselves over more than 200 years to its height of excellence in the late 17th and early 18th centuries; then the scientific investigations of its vibrational characteristics which have been done since the early 19 th century. These have progressed in spurts of activity associated with technological innovations, particularly the developments of increasingly sensitive measuring equipment. This paper attempts to cover briefly the work of the early mathematicians as well as that of Savart, Helmholtz, and Rayleigh as related to the violin; then considers the research of the 20th century from the pre-electronic investigations of Raman, Miller, and Fuhr, through the spate of activity in violin research from 1930 to 1960 particularly in Germany, the USA, and Japan; and finally a brief overview of the many current developments associated with today's electronic and optical technologies, along with the concept of the violin as a musical instrument involving research in fields as widely separated as psychoacoustics, musical composition and performance, materials research, vibration analysis, and violin making. © 1983, Acoustical Society of America.

Ultimately he posits that improvisatory behavior and exploratory engagement with material at hand is central to building pedals, and should be assessed as part of the continuum of social-aesthetic practices composing music making.}",

The ease of use of its user interface was investigated using the traditional HCI methods of heuristic evaluation and usability testing. The user interface was susequently modified, and a follow-up usability test confirmed improvements to ease of use. These findings demonstrate that HCI methods can and should be used to enhance the usability of music-related hardware.},

Following a definition of the concept of post-optimal objects, a brief history of circuit design and electronic music offers context for an analysis of recent projects, linking open documentation to invention, do it yourself, hacking, bending and selflearning. These projects are further contextualized by a series of interviews with their authors. By working through results and processes, this document exposes how these items can be described post-optimal objects. Through a personalization of the devices, these varied design methods allows individuals to curate more satisfying interactions with their instruments, audiences and professional community.},

ABSTRACT={Specialized languages for computer music have long been an important area of research in this community. Computer music languages have enabled composers who are not software engineers to nevertheless use computers effectively. While powerful general-purpose programming languages can be used for music tasks, experience has shown that time plays a special role in music computation, and languages that embrace musical time are especially expressive for many musical tasks. Time is expressed in procedural languages through schedulers and abstractions of beats, duration and tempo. Functional languages have been extended with temporal semantics, and object-oriented languages are often used to model stream-based computation of audio. This article considers models of computation that are especially important for music programming, how these models are supported in programming languages, and how this leads to expressive and efficient programs. Concrete examples are drawn from some of the most widely used music programming languages.}

title = "Tiny Jungle: Psychedelic Techniques in Audio-Visual Composition",
abstract = "Tiny Jungle (duration 7:10) [1] is a psychedelic audio- visual montage, with a soundtrack based upon electroacoustic music and late 1990s drum and bass. This work forms part of my research regarding {\textquoteleft}Altered states of consciousness (ASCs) as an adaptive principle for composing electroacoustic music{\textquoteright}. According to Heinrich Kl{\"u}ver [2] and Timothy Leary [3], ASCs such as those induced by mescaline may commonly result in the perception of visual patterns of hallucination, cryptic symbols, perception of cellular or atomic forms, and strange journeys or narratives. Tiny Jungle uses these ASC features as a basis for the composition of sound and video. Visual material for this piece was created through a montage of animated hand-drawn artwork, 3D graphics and material created using a specially designed Max/MSP/Jitter tool that produces stroboscopic visual material in real-time. The combination of music and moving images is intended to construct a narrative that conveys psychedelic experiences. In this paper I will discuss the development of Tiny Jungle from concept to realisation, with emphasis on the development of visual material and a brief overview of the soundtrack. It is hoped to thereby stimulate thought for audio-visual practitioners on compositional techniques based upon ASCs and audio-visual montage techniques involving hand-produced artwork and real-time methods.",

He played a curious device consisting of an L-shaped handle that he turned on its axis around a semicircular metal panel; as the handle moved, a connected loudspeaker emitted a keening, disembodied tone that glided and swooped, sounding either out of tune or otherworldly. This device—the Spherophone—was intended to usher in a new kind of music based on microtonal pitch increments discernable to the ear but unattainable by most},

abstract = {From the probable origins of the violin in the early 16th century there is a long history of experimentation; first, the empirical development of the violin by the makers themselves over more than 200 years to its height of excellence in the late 17th and early 18th centuries; then the scientific investigations of its vibrational characteristics which have been done since the early 19 th century. These have progressed in spurts of activity associated with technological innovations, particularly the developments of increasingly sensitive measuring equipment. This paper attempts to cover briefly the work of the early mathematicians as well as that of Savart, Helmholtz, and Rayleigh as related to the violin; then considers the research of the 20th century from the pre-electronic investigations of Raman, Miller, and Fuhr, through the spate of activity in violin research from 1930 to 1960 particularly in Germany, the USA, and Japan; and finally a brief overview of the many current developments associated with today's electronic and optical technologies, along with the concept of the violin as a musical instrument involving research in fields as widely separated as psychoacoustics, musical composition and performance, materials research, vibration analysis, and violin making. {\textcopyright} 1983, Acoustical Society of America.

The terms involved with mapping are defined, and existing literature reviewed and summarised. A model for understanding the design of such mapping strategies for electronic instruments is put forward, along with a roadmap of ongoing research focussing on the testing and evaluation of such mapping strategies. {\textcopyright} 2003, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

By studying effective acoustic instruments, choosing intuitive but complex gesture-sound mappings that take advantage of established instrumental skills, designing intelligent characterizations of performance gestures, and promoting long-term dedicated practice on a new interface, computer music instrument designers can enhance the expressive quality of computer music performance.},

The violin, one of the most refined and expressive of traditional instruments, combines a peculiar physical interface with a rich acoustic diffuser. We have built a new instrument that includes elements of both the violin's physical performance interface and its spatial filtering audio diffuser, yet eliminates both the resonating body and the strings. The instrument, BoSSA (Bowed-Sensor-Speaker-Array), is an amalgamation and extension of our previous work with violin interfaces, physical models, and directional tonal radiation studies. In addition to describing the various physical and software elements that make up BoSSA, we discuss some of its musical features and potentials; we are particularly impressed by the sense of presence and intimacy it provides, and by its potential for creating a new kind of electronic chamber music .},

We revisit questions of mapping drawing upon the theory of affordances to consider mapping and instrument together. This is applied to recent work by the author and his collaborators in the development of instruments based on mobile devices designed for specific performance situations},

abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the design of interactive virtual musical instruments intended to augment acoustic instruments in live performance. For the purposes of this work, a virtual musical instrument is defined as a computer system designed to facilitate musical expression and/or exploration. The aim of the research is to develop understanding of the nature of virtual instruments and how musicians interact with them. The approach has been to use participatory design techniques to develop a series of virtual instruments for use in live performance and then to examine closely the experiences of musicians who use them. An interaction design strategy which uses simulated physical models to mediate between the sounds produced by acoustic instruments and computer generated sounds and visuals has been developed. In this approach, a simple physical system is modelled in software and characteristics of acoustic sounds are mapped to forces and other parameters which affect the model. In response the model moves in ways that are physically realistic. These movements are then used as parameters to control video and audio synthesis. Using a research approach which draws on action research, design science and participatory design, a series of virtual instruments which use this interaction technique were developed and used in live performances. A set of initial design criteria which guided development were identified. In order to refine these criteria and better understand the impact that using these virtual instruments has on musicians' musicmaking, a series of user studies were conducted. A number of expert musicians used the virtual instruments and discussed their experiences. These sessions were video-recorded, transcribed and analysed using grounded theory techniques. The results of the study identified three modes of interaction with the virtual instruments: instrumental, conversational and ornamental. Musicians interacting with the virtual instruments in instrumental mode emphasise the importance of being in control and being able to trust that the instrument will respond consistently. When musicians use a virtual instrument ornamentally, they surrender detailed control of the generated sound and visuals to the computer, allowing it to create audio-visual layers that are added to the musicians' sound. The more complex, (and difficult to design for) conversational interaction involves the sharing of control between the musician and the virtual instrument. The balance of power is in flux, allowing the virtual instrument to talk back to the musician, reflecting and transforming the sonic input in ways that move the performance in new musical directions. The contributions of this thesis are therefore:- a set of virtual musical instruments which use a unique interaction paradigm in which simulated physical models mediate between live sounds produced on acoustic instruments and computer generated sounds and visuals; a theory of musician-virtual instrument interaction; and a set of design criteria informed by practice and user studies.},

We present the work Blue Space for oboe and interactive audiovisual system, highlighting the evolving process of the collaborative development of the work. We consider how musical and technical demands interact in this process, and outline the challenges of performing with interactive systems. Using the development of Blue Space as a self-reflective case study, we examine the role of gestures in interactive audiovisual works and identify new modes of performance.},

abstract = {The Thinking Inside the Box project (TItB) seeks to address pragmatic concerns inherent to mixed music performance, and proposes ways to better consider the sound of the acoustic reality of the concert space at studio composition time. This is achieved through empirical investigation into subversive use of recent developments in hardware and software technologies. The primary concerns are (1) optimising the integration of live instruments and electroacoustic sound in the concert hall environment for both the performers and the public, by carefully choosing loudspeaker types and placement at commission time, and by avoiding sound reinforcement; (2) minimizing for studio composers the insitu trauma of the first live rendition of the piece, by bringing the concert hall acoustic environment into the studio composition process, using convolution reverb to reproduce in the studio the given loudspeaker setup through its impulse responses. This paper presents the conclusions of the project's early experiments in the form of three case study sets, and describes how this approach will be of use for any composer of mixed music. {\textcopyright} July 2009- All copyright remains with the individual authors.},

Allen and Patricia Strange's comprehensive study critically examines extended performance techniques found in the violin literature of the latter half of the twentieth century. Drawing from both published and private manuscripts, the authors present extended performance options for the acoustic, modified, electric, and MIDI violin, with signal processing and computer-related techniques, and include more than 400 notated examples. The authors begin with bowing techniques and proceed systematically through other aspects of string playing, including MIDI technologies. Their correspondence and research with many performers and composers, the book's extensive score and text bibliography, and the discography of more than 130 recordings make The Contemporary Violin a valuable contemporary music reference and guide. An additional benefit is its listing of Internet resources that will keep the reader up to date with recent developments in contemporary performance and composition.

As a performer/composer often presenting pieces from the classical and other contemporary acoustic violin literature in traditional settings along with electronic works, and also as a teacher of interactive computer music performance at a conservatory where my students include highly trained performers, performance practice issues in computer music come up very frequently in association with the creative process. I tend to focus on creating MaxMSP patches that address a particular musical context or situation, rather than creating an elaborate versatile and reusable MaxMSP patch and then using that patch in a particular way to make music. This paper describes a few examples of my interest in this area: (i) System Aspects: Performance Practice Issues and Room Acoustics; (ii) ‘Pragmatic' Programming and Performance of Interactive Music; and (iii) Creative Process and Interactive Computer Music. {\textcopyright} 2003, Cambridge University Press.

@article{Gidion2013,
abstract = {Recent developments in minimally invasive polymer-film sensors permit the in-situ detection of mechanical vibrations in musical instruments without significantly disturbing the acoustics of the instrument. As an example, we present measurements of vibrations of a violin between the feet of the bridge and the top plate. To this end, calibrated fluoropolymer-film sensors were matched to the geometry of the bridge feet. The forces exerted on the top plate by either bridge foot can be measured separately during excitation of a string with the bow. The differences in amplitude and phase between bass and treble foot vibrations exhibit the distinctly asymmetrical nature of bridge motion which of course also depends on the string and the note that are being played, respectively. In comparison with the simultaneously detected string vibrations and the radiated sound, the filter characteristics of the bridge are clearly identified in the spectral representation. As the bridge is also the main agent for the coupling direction from the body to the string, it is suggested that the observed variations in bridge motion are closely connected to the fact that the playability of a violin changes sometimes quite drastically from note to note. {\textcopyright} 2013 Acoustical Society of America.},

The aim of the project was to develop an “invisible” technological setup that would allow the performer to move freely on stage while still being in full control of the electronics. The developed system consists of a video-based motion-tracking system, with a camera hanging in the ceiling above the stage. The performer's motion and position on stage is used to control the playback of sonic fragments from a database of violin sounds, using concatenative synthesis as the sound engine. The setup allows the performer to improvise freely together with the electronic sounds being played back as she moves around the “sonic space.” The system has been stable in rehearsal and performance, and the simplicity of the approach has been inspiring to both the performer and the audience.}",

Ultimately he posits that improvisatory behavior and exploratory engagement with material at hand is central to building pedals, and should be assessed as part of the continuum of social-aesthetic practices composing music making.}",

The ease of use of its user interface was investigated using the traditional HCI methods of heuristic evaluation and usability testing. The user interface was susequently modified, and a follow-up usability test confirmed improvements to ease of use. These findings demonstrate that HCI methods can and should be used to enhance the usability of music-related hardware.},

Following a definition of the concept of post-optimal objects, a brief history of circuit design and electronic music offers context for an analysis of recent projects, linking open documentation to invention, do it yourself, hacking, bending and selflearning. These projects are further contextualized by a series of interviews with their authors. By working through results and processes, this document exposes how these items can be described post-optimal objects. Through a personalization of the devices, these varied design methods allows individuals to curate more satisfying interactions with their instruments, audiences and professional community.},

ABSTRACT={Specialized languages for computer music have long been an important area of research in this community. Computer music languages have enabled composers who are not software engineers to nevertheless use computers effectively. While powerful general-purpose programming languages can be used for music tasks, experience has shown that time plays a special role in music computation, and languages that embrace musical time are especially expressive for many musical tasks. Time is expressed in procedural languages through schedulers and abstractions of beats, duration and tempo. Functional languages have been extended with temporal semantics, and object-oriented languages are often used to model stream-based computation of audio. This article considers models of computation that are especially important for music programming, how these models are supported in programming languages, and how this leads to expressive and efficient programs. Concrete examples are drawn from some of the most widely used music programming languages.}

title = "Tiny Jungle: Psychedelic Techniques in Audio-Visual Composition",
abstract = "Tiny Jungle (duration 7:10) [1] is a psychedelic audio- visual montage, with a soundtrack based upon electroacoustic music and late 1990s drum and bass. This work forms part of my research regarding {\textquoteleft}Altered states of consciousness (ASCs) as an adaptive principle for composing electroacoustic music{\textquoteright}. According to Heinrich Kl{\"u}ver [2] and Timothy Leary [3], ASCs such as those induced by mescaline may commonly result in the perception of visual patterns of hallucination, cryptic symbols, perception of cellular or atomic forms, and strange journeys or narratives. Tiny Jungle uses these ASC features as a basis for the composition of sound and video. Visual material for this piece was created through a montage of animated hand-drawn artwork, 3D graphics and material created using a specially designed Max/MSP/Jitter tool that produces stroboscopic visual material in real-time. The combination of music and moving images is intended to construct a narrative that conveys psychedelic experiences. In this paper I will discuss the development of Tiny Jungle from concept to realisation, with emphasis on the development of visual material and a brief overview of the soundtrack. It is hoped to thereby stimulate thought for audio-visual practitioners on compositional techniques based upon ASCs and audio-visual montage techniques involving hand-produced artwork and real-time methods.",

He played a curious device consisting of an L-shaped handle that he turned on its axis around a semicircular metal panel; as the handle moved, a connected loudspeaker emitted a keening, disembodied tone that glided and swooped, sounding either out of tune or otherworldly. This device—the Spherophone—was intended to usher in a new kind of music based on microtonal pitch increments discernable to the ear but unattainable by most},

abstract = {From the probable origins of the violin in the early 16th century there is a long history of experimentation; first, the empirical development of the violin by the makers themselves over more than 200 years to its height of excellence in the late 17th and early 18th centuries; then the scientific investigations of its vibrational characteristics which have been done since the early 19 th century. These have progressed in spurts of activity associated with technological innovations, particularly the developments of increasingly sensitive measuring equipment. This paper attempts to cover briefly the work of the early mathematicians as well as that of Savart, Helmholtz, and Rayleigh as related to the violin; then considers the research of the 20th century from the pre-electronic investigations of Raman, Miller, and Fuhr, through the spate of activity in violin research from 1930 to 1960 particularly in Germany, the USA, and Japan; and finally a brief overview of the many current developments associated with today's electronic and optical technologies, along with the concept of the violin as a musical instrument involving research in fields as widely separated as psychoacoustics, musical composition and performance, materials research, vibration analysis, and violin making. {\textcopyright} 1983, Acoustical Society of America.

By studying effective acoustic instruments, choosing intuitive but complex gesture-sound mappings that take advantage of established instrumental skills, designing intelligent characterizations of performance gestures, and promoting long-term dedicated practice on a new interface, computer music instrument designers can enhance the expressive quality of computer music performance.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Johnston2009,
abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the design of interactive virtual musical instruments intended to augment acoustic instruments in live performance. For the purposes of this work, a virtual musical instrument is defined as a computer system designed to facilitate musical expression and/or exploration. The aim of the research is to develop understanding of the nature of virtual instruments and how musicians interact with them. The approach has been to use participatory design techniques to develop a series of virtual instruments for use in live performance and then to examine closely the experiences of musicians who use them. An interaction design strategy which uses simulated physical models to mediate between the sounds produced by acoustic instruments and computer generated sounds and visuals has been developed. In this approach, a simple physical system is modelled in software and characteristics of acoustic sounds are mapped to forces and other parameters which affect the model. In response the model moves in ways that are physically realistic. These movements are then used as parameters to control video and audio synthesis. Using a research approach which draws on action research, design science and participatory design, a series of virtual instruments which use this interaction technique were developed and used in live performances. A set of initial design criteria which guided development were identified. In order to refine these criteria and better understand the impact that using these virtual instruments has on musicians' musicmaking, a series of user studies were conducted. A number of expert musicians used the virtual instruments and discussed their experiences. These sessions were video-recorded, transcribed and analysed using grounded theory techniques. The results of the study identified three modes of interaction with the virtual instruments: instrumental, conversational and ornamental. Musicians interacting with the virtual instruments in instrumental mode emphasise the importance of being in control and being able to trust that the instrument will respond consistently. When musicians use a virtual instrument ornamentally, they surrender detailed control of the generated sound and visuals to the computer, allowing it to create audio-visual layers that are added to the musicians' sound. The more complex, (and difficult to design for) conversational interaction involves the sharing of control between the musician and the virtual instrument. The balance of power is in flux, allowing the virtual instrument to talk back to the musician, reflecting and transforming the sonic input in ways that move the performance in new musical directions. The contributions of this thesis are therefore:- a set of virtual musical instruments which use a unique interaction paradigm in which simulated physical models mediate between live sounds produced on acoustic instruments and computer generated sounds and visuals; a theory of musician-virtual instrument interaction; and a set of design criteria informed by practice and user studies.},

This is achieved through empirical investigation into subversive use of recent developments in hardware and software technologies. The primary concerns are (1) optimising the integration of live instruments and electroacoustic sound in the concert hall environment for both the performers and the public, by carefully choosing loudspeaker types and placement at commission time, and by avoiding sound reinforcement; (2) minimizing for studio composers the insitu trauma of the first live rendition of the piece, by bringing the concert hall acoustic environment into the studio composition process, using convolution reverb to reproduce in the studio the given loudspeaker setup through its impulse responses.

abstract = {Recent developments in minimally invasive polymer-film sensors permit the in-situ detection of mechanical vibrations in musical instruments without significantly disturbing the acoustics of the instrument. As an example, we present measurements of vibrations of a violin between the feet of the bridge and the top plate. To this end, calibrated fluoropolymer-film sensors were matched to the geometry of the bridge feet. The forces exerted on the top plate by either bridge foot can be measured separately during excitation of a string with the bow. The differences in amplitude and phase between bass and treble foot vibrations exhibit the distinctly asymmetrical nature of bridge motion which of course also depends on the string and the note that are being played, respectively. In comparison with the simultaneously detected string vibrations and the radiated sound, the filter characteristics of the bridge are clearly identified in the spectral representation. As the bridge is also the main agent for the coupling direction from the body to the string, it is suggested that the observed variations in bridge motion are closely connected to the fact that the playability of a violin changes sometimes quite drastically from note to note. {\textcopyright} 2013 Acoustical Society of America.},
